Engraved motifs on Mesolithic pendants are extremely rare, with the exception of amber pendants from southern Scandinavia. The artwork on the pendant is the earliest known Mesolithic art in Britain; the 'barbed line' motif is comparable to styles on the Continent, particularly in Denmark. When it was first uncovered the lines were barely visible but using a range of digital imaging techniques it has been possible to examine them in detail and determine the style of engraving as well as the order in which the lines might have been made. In addition, microwear and residue analyses were applied to examine whether the pendant showed signs that it had been strung or worn, and whether the lines had been made more visible through the application of pigments, as has been suggested for some Danish amber pendants. This approach of using multiple scientific and analytical techniques has not been used previously and provides a methodology for the examination of similar artefacts in the future.</p> 	 	</div>	 </div> </a>  <a href="https://doi.org/10.11141/ia.52.5"> <div class="container"> 	 	<div class = "featuredImage"> 		<img id="featuredImage" src=" 		http://intarch.ac.uk/journal/issue52/5/images/thumbs/figure4.png 		"> 	</div> 	 	<div class = "featuredIssue"> 		<span class="title"> 		52 		</span> 	</div> 	<div class = "featuredTitle"> 		<span class="title"> 		What the Machine Saw: some questions on the ethics of computer vision and machine learning to investigate human remains trafficking 		</span> 	</div>	 	<div class = "featuredAbstract"> 	<p> 	This article represents the next step in our ongoing effort to understand the online human remains trade, how, why and where it exists on social media. It expands upon initial research to explore the'rhetoric' and structure behind the use and manipulation of images and text by this collecting community, topics explored using Google Inception v.3, TensorFlow, etc. (Huffer and Graham 2017; 2018). This current research goes beyond that work to address the ethical and moral dilemmas that can confound the use of new technology to classify and sort thousands of images. The categories used to 'train' the machine are self-determined by the researchers, but to what extent can current image classifying methods be broken to create false positives or false negatives when attempting to classify images taken from social media sales records as either old authentic items or recent forgeries made using remains sourced from unknown locations? What potential do they have to be exploited by dealers or forgers as a way to 'authenticate the market'? Analysing the data obtained when 'scraping' image or text relevant to cultural property trafficking of any kind involves the use of machine learning and neural network analysis, the ethics of which are themselves complicated. Here, we discuss these issues around two case studies; the ongoing repatriation case of Abraham Ulrikab, and an example of what it looks like when the classifier is deliberately broken. 	</p> 	</div>	 </div> </a>  <a href="https://doi.org/10.11141/ia.47.10"> <div class="container">	 	<div class = "featuredImage"> 		<img id="featuredImage" src=" 		http://intarch.ac.uk/journal/issue47/10/images/figure1th.png 		"> 	</div> 	<div class = "featuredIssue"> 		<span class="title"> 		47 		</span> 	</div> 	<div class = "featuredTitle"> 		<span class="title"> 		Day of Archaeology 2011–2017: Global Community, Public Engagement, and Digital Practice 		</span> 	</div>	 	<div class = "featuredAbstract"> 	<p> 	The Day of Archaeology (http://www.dayofarchaeology.com) was a volunteer-led international archaeological blogging event that ran from 2011 to 2017. The project asked people who define themselves as archaeologists to submit one or more blog posts about their working day on a chosen day in June or July. This article explores the history of the Day of Archaeology project and the practicalities of running a large-scale collaborative blogging project, before examining some of the topics covered in the posts. An assessment of the impact of the project follows. Overall, we hope in this work to answer some of the basic questions regarding this type of collaborative, online, global engagement – what we did, who we reached, what they talked about – and also to provide some insights for any other similar initiatives that may follow us in the future. 	</p> 	</div>	 </div> </a>  <h1>Uberlist</h1> <a href="http://intarch.ac.uk/journal/issue50/index.html"> <div class="issueContainer">	 	<div class = "issueImage"> 		<img id="issueImage" src=" 		http://intarch.ac.uk/journal/issue50/1/images/thumbs/indexth.png 		"> 	</div> 	<div class = "issueNo"> 		<span class="title"> 		50 		</span> 	</div> 	<div class = "issueTitle"> 		<span class="title"> 		Big Data on the Roman Table: new approaches to tablewares in the Roman world 		</span> 	</div>	 	<div class = "issueDesc"> 		<span class="author"> 		Edited by Penelope Allison, Martin Pitts and Sarah Colley 		</span> 	</div> </div> </a>  <a href="http://intarch.ac.uk/journal/issue49/index.html"> <div class="issueContainer">	 	<div class = "issueImage"> 		<img id="issueImage" src=" 		http://intarch.ac.uk/journal/issue49/3/images/figure1th.png 		"> 	</div> 	<div class = "issueNo"> 		<span class="title"> 		49 		</span> 	</div> 	<div class = "issueTitle"> 		<span class="title"> 		Dare to Choose — Making Choices in Archaeological Heritage Management.
